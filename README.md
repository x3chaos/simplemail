My feeble attempts at taming Jekyll

Disclaimer - this site is not a test of my CSS or HTML ability: rather, it is a challenge for me to figure out Jekyll easily and quickly, and to adapt to using Git, Jekyll and RubyGems on Ubuntu 12.04 (which is unsurprisingly easy).  
The layouts will likely suck for a while. The readme will be nothing fancy. Oh well.

LICENSE: If you honestly like my HTML and CSS enough, take 'em. Everything here's on GitHub, and is therefore open source. Poke around, have a look, maybe fork and submit me a pull request if you see a bug that you can fix.
